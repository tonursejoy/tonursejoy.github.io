    <h1>MERRY CHRISTMAS MACIHA!</h1>
    <div class="bigbox">

      <p>
        We couldn't spend this christmas together so I thought what can I do to make this whole thing better. So I made a website but like a christmas card. Idk I just thought this would be kinda cool and sweet.
        I like you a lot maciha and I'm very happy that I met you. I've had some great great memories with you. I love spending time with you.
        I can spend infinite time with you. I hope you're not annoyed that I couldn't get your presents to you on time.
        I hope we can spend next christmas together that would be cool. Also I put some pictures of us here too! You make me very happy.
        I am not that good at making websites thats why this looks a bit ass but I kept our green n purple theme going :). anyways! <b> hugs kisses and lots of love to ma belle, mon cheri, mon monde, and my beautiful bengali princess. Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year to you and your family!</b>
